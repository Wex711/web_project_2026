<h1>Pokemon heights, weights, and types</h1>
<p>In the pokemon franchise, pokemon are creatures of various shapes and sizes that inhabit
the world. Each pokemon has 1/2 elemental types, of which there are 18; The types they are 
largely determine what moves the can learn and what abilities they have. Since pokemon are typically based
on animals, just like animals, they have predetermined heights and weights that can vary by
small margins. I will list the height and weight range of each pokemon. In the pokemon franchise,
the pokedex is an electronic dictionary with descriptions of each pokemon and how they typically
act. I will be uploading these descriptions to this page with the intention of recreating the
pokedex in the form of a website.
