<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Wex. I am a third year ICT student at the University of Kentucky.</p>

<h1>My Project</h1>
<p>This semester I have been assigned to create a website. We were given creative freedom regarding what kind of 
webite we create; what I plan to do is create a functional pokedex with integrated sounds and graphics. A pokedex is an 
encyclopedia from the pokemon franchise which stores information about all of the pokemon including their noises, 
appearance, size, etc. I want to have all of this information included in my project. It is also a goal of mine to make
the website act as accurate to the pokedex in the games as possible. I will be including the original 151 pokemon.
I want to include a 3d model graphic for each pokemon. This is what a Pokedex looks like. Pokemon was a big part of my
childhood, so I kind of see this project as a tribute to it.
