<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Wex. I am a third year ICT student at the University of Kentucky.</p>
<p>I have been to Lexington, Chicago, and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This semester I have been assigned a project where I create a multiple page website that interacts with the user.
We were given creative freedom regarding what kind of webite we create; what I plan to do is create a functional pokedex
with integrated sounds and graphics. For those of you who don't know what a pokedex, it is an encyclopedia from the pokemon
franchise which stores information about all of the pokemon including their cries, appearance, color, size, etc. I want to have
all of this information in my pokedex. It is also a goal of mine to make the website look as accurate to the pokedex in the
pokemon games as possible. I will be including the original 151 pokemon and will be basing the pokedex off of the one in the
Heartgold and Soulsilver games, which came out on September 12th, 2009. I want to include a 3d model graphic for each pokemon.
</p>

<p>This is what a Pokedex looks like.</p>
